This application allows users to create Smart Playlists for Spotify. Rather than manually updating playlists, users can define rules that govern the songs in playlists. The server will then automatically update their Spotify playlists accordingly. [iTunes](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19487?locale=en_US) has had the feature for years now, but Spotify has not implemented it.
